    Classic Dijkstra's algorithm for single-source shortest path with non-negative weights.
    
    This is the gold standard shortest path algorithm for graphs with non-negative edge weights,
    serving as the baseline comparison for BMSSP performance evaluation. Dijkstra's algorithm
    is optimal in the sense that it examines each vertex exactly once and always finds the
    true shortest path.
    
    HISTORICAL CONTEXT:
    Developed by Edsger Dijkstra in 1956, this algorithm was one of the first efficient
    solutions to the shortest path problem and remains widely used today. Its elegance
    lies in the greedy approach: always process the "closest" unvisited vertex.
    
    ALGORITHM PRINCIPLE:
    The algorithm maintains a "cloud" of vertices for which shortest paths are known.
    It repeatedly:
    1. Selects the unvisited vertex with minimum distance (greedy choice)
    2. Adds it to the cloud (shortest path is now finalized)
    3. Relaxes all edges from this vertex to update neighbor distances
    
    CORRECTNESS PROOF SKETCH:
    - Invariant: All vertices in the cloud have correct shortest path distances
    - When we select vertex u with minimum distance d[u], any path to u through
      unvisited vertices would have distance ≥ d[u] (since all edge weights ≥ 0)
    - Therefore d[u] is indeed the shortest path distance to u
    
    PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS:
    - Time Complexity: O((V + E) log V) with binary heap
    - Space Complexity: O(V) for distance array and priority queue
    - Practical performance: Excellent on most real-world graphs
    
    COMPARISON WITH BMSSP:
    - Dijkstra: O(m log n), examines vertices in perfect distance order
    - BMSSP: O(m log^(2/3) n), examines vertices in approximate distance order
    - Trade-off: BMSSP sacrifices perfect ordering for better asymptotic complexity
    
    IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
    - Uses Python's heapq (binary min-heap) for priority queue
    - Implements early termination when goal is reached
    - Handles duplicate entries in priority queue (lazy deletion)
    - Reconstructs path using predecessor array
    
    Args:
        graph: Input graph with non-negative edge weights
        source: Starting vertex index (0-based)
        goal: Target vertex index (0-based)
        
    Returns:
        Tuple of (distance, path) if path exists, None otherwise
        Path is list of vertex indices from source to goal
        
    Raises:
        No exceptions - handles invalid inputs gracefully by returning None

def bellman_ford(graph: Graph, source: int, goal: int) -> Tuple[Optional[float], List[int], bool]:
    """
    Bellman-Ford algorithm for shortest paths with negative edge weights and cycle detection.
    
    This algorithm is more general than Dijkstra's algorithm as it can handle negative edge weights
    and detect negative-weight cycles. While slower than Dijkstra's O(m log n), it provides
    important theoretical foundations and serves as a comparison point for understanding
    the limitations and advantages of different shortest path approaches.
    
    HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
    - Developed independently by Richard Bellman (1955) and Lester Ford Jr. (1956)
    - Predates Dijkstra's algorithm and handles more general case
    - Foundation for many other algorithms (SPFA, distance-vector routing protocols)
    
    ALGORITHM PRINCIPLE:
    The algorithm is based on the principle of relaxation and dynamic programming:
    - After i iterations, we have found all shortest paths with at most i edges
    - Since shortest paths in a graph with n vertices have at most n-1 edges,
      n-1 iterations are sufficient to find all shortest paths
    - A final iteration detects negative cycles
    
    THEORETICAL FOUNDATION:
    - Optimal substructure: Shortest paths have shortest subpaths
    - Overlapping subproblems: Same distance computations repeated
    - Dynamic programming: Build solution incrementally
    
    KEY DIFFERENCES FROM DIJKSTRA:
    
    1. EDGE WEIGHTS: Handles negative weights (Dijkstra requires non-negative)
    2. APPROACH: Processes all edges repeatedly (Dijkstra processes vertices once)
    3. COMPLEXITY: O(VE) time (Dijkstra is O((V+E) log V))
    4. CYCLE DETECTION: Detects negative cycles (Dijkstra cannot handle them)
    5. ORDER: No specific vertex processing order (Dijkstra uses priority queue)
    
    ALGORITHM PHASES:
    
    PHASE 1: RELAXATION (V-1 iterations)
    - Relax all edges in each iteration
    - After i iterations, shortest paths with ≤ i edges are correct
    - Guarantees correctness after V-1 iterations (no negative cycles)
    
    PHASE 2: NEGATIVE CYCLE DETECTION
    - One additional iteration to check for improvements
    - If any distance can still be reduced, negative cycle exists
    - Critical for correctness in graphs with negative weights
    
    PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS:
    - Network routing protocols (distance-vector algorithms)
    - Currency arbitrage detection (negative cycles = profit opportunities)
    - Game theory and economics (negative utility cycles)
    - Constraint satisfaction problems
    
    PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS:
    - Time Complexity: O(VE) - can be slow for dense graphs
    - Space Complexity: O(V) for distance and predecessor arrays
    - Practical performance: Much slower than Dijkstra, but more general
    
    Args:
        graph: Input graph (may have negative edge weights)

        - path: List of vertices on shortest path (empty if unreachable)
        - has_negative_cycle: True if negative cycle detected
        
    Note:
        If a negative cycle is detected, shortest path distances are undefined
        The returned path may not be meaningful in the presence of negative cycles
